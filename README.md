# Aqua
I recently created a project that focused on utilizing front-end web development tools. 
Using Bootstrap, Sass, CSS, HTML, and BEM architeture, I was able to create a modern and intuitive website.
Moreover, I optimized the website's performance with a combination of custom CSS and Sass and 
employed a clean and modern design aesthetic that was both visually pleasing and user-friendly. 
To top it off, I incorporated a range of interactive components, so users could have a more engaging experience.

## Initializing the project<br>

1. `npm run build:css`<br>
*This command will generate the style.css required to style the html*<br>
2. `npm start`<br>
*This command will watch and update changes written in the Sass files to the style.css
as well as generate a live server*
